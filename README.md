# RascalC scripts
[RascalC](https://rascalc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a code for fast estimation of semi-analytical covariance matrices for galaxy 2-point correlation functions (not only, but other uses have been less common).
This is a cleaned collection of scripts utilizing its Python library (installed from <https://github.com/misharash/RascalC>).
